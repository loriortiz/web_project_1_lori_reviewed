              Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. All you actually do is memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take the test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that while you know exactly what you need to do when exam time comes around, do you truly understand the
              subject material? All you've really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is over, the information in your head has outlived its usefulness.

<!-- 
  Hello! Glad to see that your work in progress. I really like:
  1. Your flexbox skills
  2. alt attributes contain descriptive content
  3. Layout of many blocks are perfect

  These important issues should be fixed:
  1. The brief is the set of rules for us, so, please, follow it strictly. The main idea of this task
  is to stick to the brief
  2. Heading structure should be fixed
  3. Typos should be fixed
  4. All redundant wrappers and tags as br should be removed
  5. For images in html img tag should be used
  6. For text blocks p and h1-h6 tags should be used
  7. Links should contain all necessary content
  8. For absolute-positioned elements parent with position relative should be exist. Two dimensions
  should be used to control the element position entirely(right and top, for instant)
  9. z-index issue should be fixed for all elements on the page
  10. All classes should be added according to the brief, all unnecessary classed should be removed
  11. All redudant css properties that cause layout issues should be removed
  12. All css properties from the brief should be added

  Also, your work can be improved:
  1. p tag should be used for subtitles
  2. Nice formatting applied to the code
 -->
